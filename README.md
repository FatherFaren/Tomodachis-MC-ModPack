## About
This is the official Tomoe_VT modpack for the Peter's Pastures Minecraft Server. You will only need to download **ONE** version of the modpack. If you wish to use the same shaders as Tomoe, you can download the Shader File separately. (The shader will cause an error with Distant Horizons, but this is fine. Just ignore it.)

Currently, the server runs on forge version 1.20.1.

Many of the mods included are for optimization purposes and seek to increase performance for PCs with lower specs. The majority of which will be client sided.

This server is hosted by **Aternos**.
## Installation Instructions
In order to use these mods, you will first need to install **Forge Version 1.20.1** directly into folder where your minecraft launcher is located. The link is included [here](https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.20.1.html).

Once you have downloaded the correct version of forge, you will need to unzip the modpack directly into your minecraft mods folder. Make sure the file is not too deep or the game will not be able to read the files.

If you've done everything correctly, you're ready to start playing on the Minecraft Server. If you're receiving an error or the game is crashing, make sure you've done everything correctly. If you've previously modded Minecraft, make sure none of the mods you already have are not conflicting with the new mods you've installed. You should receive a pop-up that tells you which mods are causing trouble and you should temporarily disable them.

It's recommended that if you do have mods, that you create a backup folder. Then, do a clean install of this modpack to ensure a smoother experience. If problems persist, please contact FatherFaren, M, or another member of the Tomoe's Second Life Mod Team. We will get back to you as soon as we can.
## Shader Installation Instructions
Tomoe_VT is currently using the [Bliss Shader](https://github.com/X0nk/Bliss-Shader/releases) by X0nk. It is an edit of Chocapic13's V9 medium and uses code from other Chocapic13's v9 versions. The original of which can be found [here](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/shaders/chocapic13-shaders).

As stated above, Distant Horizons doesn't really play nice with Bliss Shader, but it's fine. Just place the Bliss Shader file into your minecraft shaders folder. Then, Launch Minecraft, go to video settings and locate the shaders option and select the Bliss Shader. These instructions work for most shaders.

### Regarding Lag
There is a possibility that you may experience lag. Before reaching out to a member of the mod team, try increasing the amount of memory allocated to Minecraft. To do this, go into your **Minecraft Launcher**. Go to **Installations** and locate the **Forge** profile. Then click **Edit Profile** and then **More Options**.
Where it says:

> -Xmx2G -XX:+Unlock...

change the "2" to the amount of GB of RAM you wish to use. For these mods with the Bliss Shader, 6-8 RAM is recommended. If you play on higher/max settings 8 is recommended. Avoid using too much RAM as that can also cause lag.
