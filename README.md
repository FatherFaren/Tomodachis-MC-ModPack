# Tomodachis-MC-ModPack

This is the official Tomoe_VT modpack for the Peter's Pastures Minecraft Server. You will only need to download **ONE** version of the modpack. If you wish to use your own shaders, you should download the file without the shaders included. Many of the mods included are for optimization purposes and seek to increase performance. Overall, they shouldn't be taxing.

If you don't already, it is recommended you install the CurseForge which is included below for your convenience. If you would rather download it directly from the CurseForge website, you can get it [here](https://www.curseforge.com/download/app). Download the **STANDALONE**. Pay attention or you'll end up downloading the OVERWOLF app onto your computer in addition to the CurseForge App.

Once you have the CurseForge App installed. Click the + and add **New Game**. Then select Minecraft from the list of options.

Click on Minecraft then select import. You will be prompted to select a zip file or a link. Select the Zipfile containing the modpack and it should install automatically.
